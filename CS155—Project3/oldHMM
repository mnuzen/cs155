# Problem Set 6
#
# Author:       Andrew Kang
# Description:  Set 6 skeleton code
########################################

# You can use this (optional) skeleton code to complete the HMM
# implementation of set 5. Once each part is implemented, you can simply
# execute the related problem scripts (e.g. run 'python 2G.py') to quickly
# see the results from your code.
#
# Some pointers to get you started:
#
#     - Choose your notation carefully and consistently! Readable
#       notation will make all the difference in the time it takes you
#       to implement this class, as well as how difficult it is to debug.
#
#     - Read the documentation in this file! Make sure you know what
#       is expected from each function and what each variable is.
#
#     - Any reference to "the (i, j)^th" element of a matrix T means that
#       you should use T[i][j].
#
#     - Note that in our solution code, no NumPy was used. That is, there
#       are no fancy tricks here, just basic coding. If you understand HMMs
#       to a thorough extent, the rest of this implementation should come
#       naturally. However, if you'd like to use NumPy, feel free to.
#
#     - Take one step at a time! Move onto the next algorithm to implement
#       only if you're absolutely sure that all previous algorithms are
#       correct. We are providing you waypoints for this reason.
#
# To get started, just fill in code where indicated. Best of luck!

class HiddenMarkovModel:
    '''
    Class implementation of Hidden Markov Models.
    '''

    def __init__(self, A, O):
        '''
        Initializes an HMM. Assumes the following:
            - States and observations are integers starting from 0.
            - There is a start state (see notes on A_start below). There
              is no integer associated with the start state, only
              probabilities in the vector A_start.
            - There is no end state.

        Arguments:
            A:          Transition matrix with dimensions L x L.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        transitioning from state i to state j. Note that
                        this does not include the starting probabilities.

            O:          Observation matrix with dimensions L x D.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        emitting observation j given state i.

        Parameters:
            L:          Number of states.

            D:          Number of observations.

            A:          The transition matrix.

            O:          The observation matrix.

            A_start:    Starting transition probabilities. The i^th element
                        is the probability of transitioning from the start
                        state to state i. For simplicity, we assume that
                        this distribution is uniform.
